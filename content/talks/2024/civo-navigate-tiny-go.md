In this talk, Sergio Méndez is going to give us an introduction about how TinyGo can be used to set up IoT devices and how you can use it to run small pieces of code using WebAssembly, also explaining the benefits of using TinyGo on IoT Edge systems. During this talk Sergio will show how to design and use TinyGo to set up a Raspberry Pico as an IoT device that reads information from sensors, and how to run a small piece of code using Wasm in a Raspberry Pi cluster running K3s (a light weight Kubernetes) with WasmEdge as a Wasm runtime for edge. Across this talk Sergio is going to explain how these components of an edge computing system interact with each other to bring analytics to edge users by using dashboards by using Grafana or similar tools.
