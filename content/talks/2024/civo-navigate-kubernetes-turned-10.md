Kubernetes is facing a challenge. It's no longer the only game in town for managing complex applications. With the rise of Web3 and distributed computing, there's a whole new world of options that don't rely on centralized control. Technologies like IPFS for sharing files in a peer-to-peer network, DLT platforms like ICP for running decentralized apps, and Golem for tapping into a global pool of computing power are showing us a different way to do things. These technologies are built on the idea of spreading out resources and control, making systems more resilient and less dependent on any single point of failure. It raises a big question: In this shift towards decentralized tech, does Kubernetes still have a role to play, or is it becoming a relic of the old way of doing things?.
