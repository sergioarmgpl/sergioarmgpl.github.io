In this talk, Sergio Méndez shows us how Kubernetes can be used to monitor plants in gardens or farms using edge Kubernetes clusters in order to implement smart farm systems. This talk also presents a short demo, showing how you can monitor the temperature and humidity in a garden to take actions like watering plants. This demo runs using some basic sensors, K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes, and MySQL together with Grafana to show weather metrics of your garden or farm in real-time. During the talk, the attendee will learn how to implement a basic smart farm system using Kubernetes at the edge.
