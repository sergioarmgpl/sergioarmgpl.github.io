In this session, Sergio Méndez is going to share his experience and history behind why and what motivated him to write his book “Edge Computing with Kubernetes” by Packt publisher. After this introduction, he is going to give a walkthrough of the different chapters of the book explaining in a practical way how to use the content of each chapter to solve your day-to-day edge computing system problems and how to run your edge systems on ARM devices with the lightweight Kubernetes K3s.
