I just introduced the attendees to the theory behind Ortelius.

Description: From early on the Ortelius team had seen value in events and how they can solve many of our problems that we face in our DevOps processes, particularly around Interoperability.

As they embarked on their journey implementing GitOps, they then realized that there were a lot of moving parts and tools in their CI/CD process so decided to adopt Keptn as the control plane to handle events. In this session we will explore how Ortelius, Keptn and GitOps forms a new kind of pipeline that incorporates a central catalog for tracking the DevOps data in an event driven CD Pipeline.
