In this talk, Sergio Méndez will show us how K3s (a lightweight Kubernetes) is used to create a small edge computing system that monitors temperature and humidity in real-time at the Civo Navigate event. During this talk, Sergio will show the different parts of this small edge computing system, including a short explanation of how MySQL, Grafana, and K3s are used and interact with each other to show this information in real-time, all this running on a small K3s cluster using Raspberry Pi devices.
