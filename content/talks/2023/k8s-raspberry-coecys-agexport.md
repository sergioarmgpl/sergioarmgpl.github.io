In this talk, Sergio Méndez is going to talk about Internal Developer Platforms (IDP), and all the concepts around IDPs and platform engineering, and how companies can start building IDPs using ArgoCD and Github Actions.

During this talk, Sergio is going to show a small self-service implementation with ArgoCD to create Kubernetes applications using Github Actions forms to execute pipelines that create ArgoCD applications definitions that ArgoCD can use to provision applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
