In this session, Sergio Méndez demonstrates how students can learn about service meshes and cloud-native technologies using Linkerd in a university setting.
During the session, Sergio showcases a university project that used Linkerd for observability and multi-cluster interconnection. The real-time system simulates the comments and analytics for soccer matches in an event called Usactar based on the last World Cup in Qatar.
During the demonstration, Sergio will show how this system works, how to observe message queues in Kafka and how Linkerd uses a multi-cloud configuration to distribute components and data around different cloud providers.
