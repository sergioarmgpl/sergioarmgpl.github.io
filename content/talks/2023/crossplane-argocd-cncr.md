In this talk, Sergio Méndez will show us how to manage infrastructure in Kubernetes using ArgoCD and Crossplane. He will explain the basics of these tools and how they integrate with Kubernetes. Attendees will learn how to install and configure these tools in their own environment and how to use their features to provision cloud infrastructure for different cloud providers. At the end, Sergio will show a small implementation of how to provision infrastructure in Google Cloud using ArgoCD and Crossplane.
