In this talk Sergio presents different use case scenarios where people can use K3s(a lightweight Kubernetes) to implement an edge computing system that measures temperature and humidity sensors to build a smart farm. Smart farms have a lot of use cases in Latin American countries where agriculture is an important way for income. During the talk Sergio will explain how to design a basic smart farm system using the different edge computing layers to design this system. At the end of this talk Sergio is going to show a basic smart farm implementation using K3s and Raspberry Pi devices, temperature and humidity sensors, MySQL and Grafana, showing in real-time how to monitor plants in gardens or farms.
