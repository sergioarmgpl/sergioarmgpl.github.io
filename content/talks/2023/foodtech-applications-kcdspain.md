In this talk Sergio Méndez will talk to us about how Agritech and Foodtech solutions running on the edge can help automate applications on farms that can help optimize processes in crops, fertilizer, or food generation, etc., and how these processes can generate an environment sustainable where the impact on the environment is reduced. Sergio will also explain how Agritech and Foodtech can revolutionize food production in Latin America, creating low-cost solutions, using K3s, a light Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, accompanied by ARM hardware devices such as Raspberry Pi, for home projects. or productive use. At the end he will explain how Agritech and Foodtech are related to the TAG Environmental Sustainability, promoted in CNCF to have technological solutions that reduce the impact on the environment.
