This talk presents the challenges to perform continuous deployment for chatbots or ML applications on the edge using Argo CD & Workflows , and how you can use K3s as the main Kubernetes distribution to build edge computing systems. It also focuses in the strategies to do massive deployments on edge devices using ARM processors with Argo, combined with the power of K3s, and storage on the public cloud to fit IoT requirements and a lightweight environment for continuous deployments. At the end of this talk, the speaker presents a short demo, showing a hybrid edge system using public cloud services from GCP to store data for the edge cluster and the applications, and the execution of continuous deployment of ML model in some K3s clusters running on Raspberry Pi’s.
