The students of USAC, university of Guatemala presented a project about a high concurrency system that displays real time information about Covid-19, this project used Cloud Native technologies such as Kubernetes, Linkerd, gRPC, Prometheus and others. Charles Pretzer from Linkerd Community and Field Engineer of Buoyant, helped us answering questions and promoted students to Join the Linkerd Community. This was one of many sessions that try to involve students into the CNCF ecosystems, we also promoted the hashtag #cncfstudents to share students work on the social networks, my role was to organize the event and help the students to present the project to the linkerd people.
