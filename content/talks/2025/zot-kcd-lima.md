In this talk, Sergio Méndez explains how you can use Zot as a lightweight container registry that supports OCI compliance, allowing you to store anything as an artifact, not just containers.
During the talk, Sergio explains how to quickly and easily implement a container registry for your test, production, or edge environments using Zot.
At the end, Sergio will demonstrate how to manage OCI-compliant containers or artifacts with Zot using ORAS to upload artifacts to this container registry.
