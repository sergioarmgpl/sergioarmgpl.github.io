In March, it was hosted our online Meetup with the Cloud Native Guatemala community and special guests. It was discussed the experiences of various females who have worked with Cloud Native tools, either in their daily work or because of their interest in the cloud world.

We'll also discuss the progress of KCD Guatemala 2025 in Antigua, Guatemala, and hold a swag giveaway.

I was a presenter in this talk.
