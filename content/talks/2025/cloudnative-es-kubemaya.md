In this session, Sergio Méndez presents a new open-source project called KubeMaya, used and developed by students at USAC University in Guatemala to run AI programs in archaeological research. The concept behind this project is to create a platform that runs AI programs on edge devices cost-effectively and can be used by people without in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. KubeMaya automates the installation of K3s (lightweight Kubernetes) in an isolated, internet-free environment and simplifies the process of installing new applications on the device using .tgz and YAML files. It also implements a basic graphical user interface with Python to manage Kubernetes deployments using the Kubernetes API.
By the end of the session, attendees will learn how to set up an isolated environment with K3s and install applications manually, with or without KubeMaya, as well as the different use cases where Kubernetes can be useful in research or IoT scenarios.
