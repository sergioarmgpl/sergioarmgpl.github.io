Join us for an introduction to Kairos with CNCF Ambassador, Sergio Mendez. This is a powerful CNCF project designed to simplify and secure Kubernetes deployments at the edge. Kairos enables the creation of immutable, declarative Linux-based OS images that come bundled with Kubernetes—perfect for edge environments, bare-metal clusters, and IoT applications. With features like over-the-air updates, rollback support, and secure boot, Kairos brings modern DevOps principles to edge computing. Whether you're deploying in low-connectivity scenarios or need a consistent, reproducible operating system for Kubernetes nodes, Kairos offers a flexible and resilient solution. Don’t miss this session to explore how Kairos is transforming cloud native infrastructure at the edge.
