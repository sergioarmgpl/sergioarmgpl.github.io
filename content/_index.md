### My short Bio
Sergio Méndez is a systems engineer and professor of operating systems at USAC Guatemala university. He has experience working on DevOps, and MLOps using open source technologies at work. About open source communities, he is involved in the CNCF Community, promoting students into the CNCF Ecosystem and hosting a Cloud Native meetup in Guatemala.

### Current projects
I am currently working in a project called KubeMaya which is a platform to prepare edge devices using ARM to run AI programs. This plataform using K3s (A lightweight Kubernetes) running in a Air-gapped environment. The idea is to use KubeMaya to run applications that we are developing in USAC University in Guatemala to run AI programs that helps in local archeologists in their research related to archeology.

If you want to check KubeMaya is [here](https://github.com/sergioarmgpl/kubemaya)

Currently I am working with 3 students with a thesis that are related to image analysis, and we are going to use part of this research in this new project. So let's see what the future brings to me.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:
