### My short Bio to start...
Hi I am Sergio Méndez - a systems engineer and professor of operating systems at USAC Guatemala university. I have experience working on DevOps, MLOps and open source technologies at work. Speaking of open source communities - I am pretty active in the CNCF Community, promoting students into the CNCF Ecosystem and hosting Cloud Native meetings in Guatemala. I have been a speaker at a number of conferences around the world, such as KubeCon, WTFisCloudNative, and Kubernetes Community Days. Currently, I am a CNCF and Linkerd Ambassador. Recently I became a distinguished ARM ambassador. Finally, I am the author of the Packt book “Edge Computing Systems with Kubernetes”. Writing the book was a big challenge.

### My Current Projects???
I am currently working on a project called KubeMaya. It is a platform to prepare edge devices using ARM to run AI programs. This plataform uses K3s (A lightweight Kubernetes) running in a Air-gapped environment. The idea is to use KubeMaya to run applications that we are developing in USAC University in Guatemala to run AI programs. This helps in local archeologists in their research related to archeology.

If you want to check KubeMaya is [here](https://github.com/sergioarmgpl/kubemaya)

Currently I am working with 3 students whose thesis’ are related to image analysis. We are going to use part of this research in this new project. So let’s see what the future brings to me.
