It was discussed the experiences of various females who have worked with Cloud Native tools, either in their daily work or because of their interest in the cloud world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss the progress of KCD Guatemala 2025 in Antigua, Guatemala, and hold a swag giveaway.&lt;/p>
