This talk also presents different use case scenarios where you can use K3s, temperature and humidity sensors to start building a smart farm. During the talk the speaker will show the different layers of and edge computing systems and where are the different pieces of a smart farm located across these layers. At the end of this talk Sergio is going to show a basic weather monitoring system implemented using K3s and Raspberry Pi devices, temperature and humidity sensors, MySQL and Grafana, showing in real-time how to monitor plants in gardens or farms. This example represents the basis of complex smart farms use cases.&lt;/p>

During this talk, Sergio will show the different parts of this small edge computing system, including a short explanation of how MySQL, Grafana, and K3s are used and interact with each other to show this information in real-time, all this running on a small K3s cluster using Raspberry Pi devices.&lt;/p>
