&lt;p>Description: From early on the Ortelius team had seen value in events and how they can solve many of our problems that we face in our DevOps processes, particularly around Interoperability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As they embarked on their journey implementing GitOps, they then realized that there were a lot of moving parts and tools in their CI/CD process so decided to adopt Keptn as the control plane to handle events. In this session we will explore how Ortelius, Keptn and GitOps forms a new kind of pipeline that incorporates a central catalog for tracking the DevOps data in an event driven CD Pipeline.&lt;/p>
