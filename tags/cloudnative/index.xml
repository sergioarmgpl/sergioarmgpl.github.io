These devices often use ARM processors that match the low power consumption edge environments and have limited CPU and RAM to run your code. This talk is going to cover the basics of running serverless functions at the edge using Knative deployed at the edge in a light weight Kubernetes K3s. The demo of this session will show how to install Knative at the edge in a single node K3s cluster in a Raspberry Pi device as our edge device using an ARM processor. It also explained how this configuration can run your code in an efficient way managing endpoints for your code and concurrency using the internal envoy based proxy Contour that runs at the edge. At the end of the session we explain the pros and cons of running serverless functions at the edge and the challenges for development when using ARM devices, and how Knative with K3s can solve common edge computing use cases like smart farms, smart cities, etc.&lt;/p>

Also he will present different strategies that he is using to update his content to introduce several CNCF open source projects such as Kubernetes as part of his course content, sharing the challenges of doing these changes. At the middle of the presentation, Sergio will share his experience hosting a Kubernetes Community Days in Guatemala with the participation of his students. Telling the audience in detail, how he organized this event, how he organized his students, speakers, the schedule, etc. At the end, Sergio presents the benefits that his students got when they participated in these events, and how now his students are participating in giving talks on local cloud native communities and events like KubeCon, applying for internships and getting jobs outside Guatemala.&lt;/p>

This talk also presents different use case scenarios where you can use K3s, temperature and humidity sensors to start building a smart farm. During the talk the speaker will show the different layers of and edge computing systems and where are the different pieces of a smart farm located across these layers. At the end of this talk Sergio is going to show a basic weather monitoring system implemented using K3s and Raspberry Pi devices, temperature and humidity sensors, MySQL and Grafana, showing in real-time how to monitor plants in gardens or farms. This example represents the basis of complex smart farms use cases.&lt;/p>
