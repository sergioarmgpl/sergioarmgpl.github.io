Specifically the ones that use devices with ARM processors that have a low power consumption. The talk also shows how Flux and K3s (A lightweight Kubernetes) can be used to implement continuous deployment for different needs on the edge context and the challenges of it.
In the live demonstration, Sergio will show how to implement continuous deployment for a simple edge application that changes the color of a LED running on a Raspberry Pi device using K3s.&lt;/p>
