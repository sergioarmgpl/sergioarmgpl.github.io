During the session, Sergio showcases a university project that used Linkerd for observability and multi-cluster interconnection. The real-time system simulates the comments and analytics for soccer matches in an event called Usactar based on the last World Cup in Qatar.
During the demonstration, Sergio will show how this system works, how to observe message queues in Kafka and how Linkerd uses a multi-cloud configuration to distribute components and data around different cloud providers.&lt;/p>

Specifically the ones that use devices with ARM processors that have a low power consumption. The talk also shows how Flux and K3s (A lightweight Kubernetes) can be used to implement continuous deployment for different needs on the edge context and the challenges of it.
In the live demonstration, Sergio will show how to implement continuous deployment for a simple edge application that changes the color of a LED running on a Raspberry Pi device using K3s.&lt;/p>

It also focuses in the strategies to do massive deployments on edge devices using ARM processors with Argo, combined with the power of K3s, and storage on the public cloud to fit IoT requirements and a lightweight environment for continuous deployments. At the end of this talk, the speaker presents a short demo, showing a hybrid edge system using public cloud services from GCP to store data for the edge cluster and the applications, and the execution of continuous deployment of ML model in some K3s clusters running on Raspberry Pi’s.&lt;/p>

He also presents how a student with the right skills will be able to tap into the global tech market, and how they may well innovate in their own countries, focusing on Guatemala.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He also will share his lessons learned and the challenges he found to choose the right content, to teach cloud native technologies like Kubernetes, Linkerd, or Chaos Mesh. He also explains how academia can help companies to adopt these technologies and the culture around cloud native.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, Sergio will share how organizations like CNCF and projects like Linkerd, Chaos Mesh, and Curiefense are opening opportunities for students like speaking in conferences like KubeCon, Community Groups, internships, or doing contributions, giving real examples about what his students are doing in Central America.&lt;/p>
